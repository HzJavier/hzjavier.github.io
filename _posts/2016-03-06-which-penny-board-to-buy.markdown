**TL;DR:** Want a decent board for reasonable price, buy the High Bounce. Want the best available board, buy the Penny Skateboard.

**Disclaimer:** For this guide, consider:

- I’m new to skateboarding.
- I was biased to products available in México.
- I didn’t want to spend a lot in a casual-ride board.
- I weight about 75Kg, so I discarded any board that cannot carry me.

I need a quick method to transport myself inside my office. At [Wize Services](https://www.facebook.com/WizeServices), we just moved to our new offices which are way bigger than our old ones. This meant that the kitchen, the bathroom and some meeting rooms are far.

A couple of friends bought 22” penny boards for quick transport. I decided to buy one as well, but wanted to do a research first. Here are my findings:

- Penny Skateboards seem to be the original ones, they are the best but also very expensive relative to others.
- Some people told me the boards have metal dipsticks for support, but I don’t think any of them have.
- That said, looks like all of them can be broken under some circumstances (see Amazon 1 star reviews).

### High Bounce reviews

There are two YouTube unboxing/reviews for the High Bounce. Both of them are lame, but just in case you care:
